**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Jack Alexander

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [yes] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [yes] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [yes] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [yes] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [yes] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [yes] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [yes] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Scorestreak
- Volume button

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I lost the website I used to find out how to add a volume button but I used a website that showed me how to do it.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge that I came across was definitely using languages that I have very little exposure to. For example, HTML was very difficult for me to understand because I’ve only had experience with object-oriented languages like Java or Python. The same goes for CSS since it also isn’t object-oriented or familiar. However, the tutorial walking me through the languages and the explanations of how they worked definitely helped me grasp a stronger understanding of the languages and how they can be used together to create websites that incorporate front-ends and back-ends and styling that is appealing to the user. Javascript was actually familiar in that it is an object-oriented language and a lot of my coursework in Java which is also an object-oriented language helped me do the things that I did in Javascript because of the similarities between them. For example, I know there aren’t any classes or methods in Javascript but there are functions that are equivalent to methods in Java. This similarity helped as well as the passing and receiving of parameters through the parentheses. Although they aren’t the exact same, the similarities and tactics that I’ve developed while using Java came into use while coding the back-end.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

A question that I have about web development is why we have to use multiple languages for styling, formatting, and logic. For example, in Java, there are ways to create GUIs, format them, add color to them, and make the backend behind them as well. Why can’t we do something like that with websites? Is it something that would be too difficult to achieve? Or could it be that this way is just simpler to use and understand than alternative ways? I would also like to know the limits of it. Particularly, can you program artificial intelligence with HTML, CSS, and Javascript? How far can we go with just these three languages without having to incorporate other languages as well?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

With more time to work on this project, I would have probably assigned the 4 buttons to different music genres which, when pressed, would play a random snippet from a youtube playlist of that genre for the amount of time the button is pressed. This would definitely be harder as I’d have to use APIs and incorporate their use into the game. Something else that would have been interesting to add is a way to compete with other players. For example, who could get the highest score not only on your computer but on other computers. Essentially it would be a scoreboard. I would add timers to see who could accomplish “X” amount of score in “Y” amount of time. This would of course, force me into using some form of database where I store values with certain characters and add a login function.
